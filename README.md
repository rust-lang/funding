# Funding
This repository serves for discussions and design documents about funding Rust maintainers, such as via the [Rust Foundation Maintainer Fund](https://rustfoundation.org/media/announcing-the-rust-foundation-maintainers-fund/) (RFMF).

It is also used to coordinate the work of the [Rust Foundation Maintainer Fund Design subcommittee](https://github.com/rust-lang/leadership-council/pull/248).
